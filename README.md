## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to help **Sales Managers** monitor and analyze their team's sales performance each quarter. By building an interactive dashboard, managers can quickly see opportunities won and lost, compare quarterly trends, and evaluate individual sales agentsâ€™ results.

## Dataset Used

The project uses two datasets:

- **sales_pipeline.csv**: Contains detailed information on sales opportunities, including deal stage, dates, products, and deal values.  
- **sales_teams.csv**: Contains information about sales agents, their managers, and regional offices.

The datasets consist of approximately 8,800 records and 18 fields, representing B2B sales pipeline data.

## Questions (KPIs) Addressed

- How many sales opportunities were won or lost each quarter?  
- What is the percentage of deals won vs. lost per quarter?  
- Which sales agents performed best in terms of deals won?  
- How does sales performance vary by regional office and manager?
