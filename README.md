## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to help **Sales Managers** monitor and analyze their team's sales performance each quarter. By building an interactive dashboard, managers can quickly see opportunities won and lost, compare quarterly trends, and evaluate individual sales agentsâ€™ results.

## Dataset Used

The dataset is fully embedded within the Excel file, including sales pipeline and sales team details. This allows the dashboard to be fully functional without requiring external data files.

## Questions (KPIs) Addressed

- How many sales opportunities were won or lost each quarter?  
- What is the percentage of deals won vs. lost per quarter?  
- Which sales agents performed best in terms of deals won?  
- How does sales performance vary by regional office and manager?
